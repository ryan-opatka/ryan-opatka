### 📜 About Me

I didn’t set out to be an engineer—I just kept trying to fix things.

I began studying neuroscience, drawn to the questions of consciousness, cognition, and the hidden architectures of the mind. That fascination eventually led me to machine learning—and reignited a deeper love: building and tinkering.

I changed my major to Computer Science my second year at Northwestern University, where I could explore intelligence both theoretically and practically, while learning how to bring my ideas into the world through code.

Since then, I’ve worked across AI, research labs, and software development—always leading with enthusiasm, clarity, and embracing the question:  
**“How can we make this better?”**

I care deeply about building *good products*—tools that are meaningful, usable, and grounded in vision. Every day, I’m refining my ability to understand real needs, design sharp solutions, and remain agile, collaborative, and thoughtful throughout the development process.

### 🔧 What I Build

- 🧠 Thoughtful tools powered by AI and machine learning—*not gimmicks*. I care about solving real problems with systems that are accurate, testable, and grounded in hard-earned insight.
- 🧩 Systems that hold up under pressure. Reliable, maintainable, well-documented solutions that feel clean to use—and clean to inherit.
- 🌐 Full-stack web apps across a variety of stacks—often React, Next.js, Tailwind, Firebase, and more—turning messy building blocks into something elegant and intuitive.
- 🧪 Experiments that pull me in and make me curious again. I love exploring ideas that don't yet have a name, just a question.

### 🌱 What I’m Working On

- 🧠 Building a **self-improvement engine**—part journal, part coach, part OS for staying aligned with my values. It delivers personalized prompts, behavioral insights, and daily reflection tools powered by LLMs and habit design research. I'm designing it to be useful first and foremost to me—because if I wouldn’t use it, I shouldn’t build it.
- 🌐 Developing **my personal site**—a modular portfolio and playground to showcase my work and explore new stacks, frameworks, and design patterns.
- 📚 Diving deeper into **machine learning**, reinforcement learning, and the infrastructure behind modern AI tooling.
- 🦾 Training in **Muay Thai**, running regularly, and practicing clean eating and supplementation. Engineering the body alongside the mind.
- 🧪 Constantly experimenting—with code, with process, with self. I believe iteration, reflection, and relentless curiosity are the only real way forward.

### 🧬 Why I Build

I build because I can’t not.  
Because something in me breaks when I see broken systems failing people who deserve better.

Technology isn’t inherently good—but with intention, clarity, and care, it can be used to build things that *are*.

I want to create tools that promote wellness, level the playing field, and give people more control over their time, decisions, and lives.

I was conditioned to think this way. My dad invented toys for a living—he believed in joy, connection, and designing for others.  
I’m trying to do the same, just with different tools.

### 🛡️ Leadership Philosophy

I believe leadership is power held beneath the surface—expressed through empathy, clarity, discernment, and unwavering commitment to a shared vision.

Good leadership isn't about domination or ego. It's about helping people move along their own virtue toward their own highest potential, in service of something greater than any one individual. 
It's about never assigning a task you wouldn’t take on yourself—and humbly taking ownership for both the actions and inactions of those you lead.

When I lead, I want people to feel encouraged as they walk the line between hard-earned capabilities and novel challenges.
I invest in building trust, creating momentum, and making sure every contributor feels seen, valued, and capable of delivering their best.

### 🎯 How I Approach Building

Before you build, you have to dream vividly.  
If you can’t see what perfect could look like, you're not ready to start.

I believe in spending time upfront to understand users, map possibilities, and set a clear, ambitious vision. 
We have too much "good enough" in the world. I want to build things that make people feel something—that make them *care*.

I believe products should have soul.  
Art, creativity, and human experience are not relics of the past—they’re necessary for building systems that serve people, not just markets.

If what we’re building doesn’t move us, why are we building it at all?

---

### 🫀 Who I Am

I’m a team builder. I love when people get excited with me—when we can share momentum, chase ideas, and pull each other forward.

I believe in boosting morale, not just velocity. In honest conversations about progress, blockers, strengths, and limits—so we can actually grow, together.

I’ve led teams before. Sometimes that meant helping others catch up, but it always meant creating space for people to show up fully. I invest in people because I want us all to excel—not just deliver.

When something breaks, I don’t panic. I trace it. I fix it. I write a test. I document it.  
I believe in **thoughtful design, transparent collaboration**, and shipping when it’s ready—not when it’s perfect.

### 🗺️ What I Want

Right now? **A job. A team. A structure I can thrive in.**

Long term? **I want to lead the development of something new.**  
Something that matters. Something that reaches people and stays with them.

I want to build products that empower, simplify, and restore agency—especially for those who don’t usually get it.  
Tools that promote equity and reflection: tools that actually help.

Not because it’s trendy.  
Because it’s needed.

The dream is big. The code is small. But the direction is clear.

### 🕰️ GitHub History

This repository is the first step in consolidating my work into a cohesive portfolio.  
I've built extensively in academic, professional, and personal environments—but until now, my public GitHub presence didn't reflect it.  
I'm excited to finally start building here, with the same energy, discipline, and imagination I've always brought to my work.
